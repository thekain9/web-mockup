# 1. WEBSITE MOCK-UP 
Here's my first website! :grin: I built it using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was a fun project where I got to play around with simple tools and learn about **website design.**

# 2. CONTENT 
I've crafted a dynamic website comprising three HTML pages styled using CSS, with the added benefit of Bootstrap for ensuring a seamless layout of elements. The site encompasses a visually appealing landing page, an informative 'About Me' page, and a user-friendly contact page featuring a well-designed form. Additionally, I've implemented a collapsible "hamburger" menu using CSS, providing users with an efficient navigation experience.

# 3. JS FUNCTIONALITY
### 1. Slide Show Functionality

I've integrated a slide show functionality using JavaScript, enabling smooth transitions between slides and interactive navigation for users. The script includes next/previous controls and dynamically updates dot indicators, enhancing the visual appeal and user engagement of the website.

### 2. Save For Later Functionality

One of the standout features involves allowing users to save their favorite images. Through JavaScript, users can mark images, and the script stores these selections, providing a count of saved images. This enhances user interactivity and personalization on the site.

### 3. Leave Comment Functionality

For user engagement and interaction, I've implemented a comment feature. Users can leave comments on specific sections of the site by entering text and submitting. The comments are then dynamically displayed on the page, enhancing the community feel of the website.

### 4. Like Slide Functionality

To further enhance user interaction, the JavaScript functionality includes a 'Like' feature. Users can express their appreciation for specific slides by clicking a 'Like' button. The state of these likes is saved locally, ensuring a personalized and memorable user experience.

# 4. HOW TO USE
To experience these features, simply navigate through the website and engage with the provided elements:

- Slide Show: Explore the various sections of the site to witness the engaging slide show.

- Save For Later: Click on the designated button to save your favorite images and receive a count of saved items.

# 5. CONCLUSION
Embarking on the creation of my first website has been an enlightening journey into the realms of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project allowed me to explore the fundamentals of website design, resulting in a dynamic online presence.

The site features a visually engaging landing page, an insightful 'About Me' section, and an intuitive contact page with a well-designed form. The addition of a collapsible "hamburger" menu further enhances user navigation.

It was also immensely enjoyable to play with typography, a creative endeavor that added an extra layer of flair to the overall design.
